>>>1. Garbage collection:
=======================
The main objective of GC is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects. An objects said to be unreachable it its doesnot have any refrence.

>> Way to make object eligibale fot GC.
1. Nullifying
2. Re-assigining
3. Object crated inside method.
4. Island of isolation

>> Way of requesting JVM to GC
1. System.gc()
2. Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
But no gurantee that any of these will run.

>>Types of activity of GC,
1. Minor: its happen when unreachable objects in the yung generation heap memory are removed.
2. Major: Its happen objects survived the minor GC, and copied into old genration memeory are removed.

>> Diffrent classification of objects by GC in heap memeory.
1. Young generation
> eden
> s0,s1 (surviver space)
2. Old generation.
>tenured
3. Permanent generation
>permamanet

>> Diff Types of GC:
1. Searial
2. Parallel
3. CMS
4. G1(Garbaze first)

>>>2. Serialiaztion:

Symmetric (shared key)
Asymmetric(RSA key pair)
