>>>1. Garbage collection:
=======================
The main objective of GC is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects. An objects said to be unreachable it its doesnot have any refrence.

>> Way to make object eligibale fot GC.
1. Nullifying
2. Re-assigining
3. Object crated inside method.
4. Island of isolation

>> Way of requesting JVM to GC
1. System.gc()
2. Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
But no gurantee that any of these will run.

>>Types of activity of GC,
1. Minor: its happen when unreachable objects in the yung generation heap memory are removed.
2. Major: Its happen objects survived the minor GC, and copied into old genration memeory are removed.

>> Diffrent classification of objects by GC in heap memeory.
1. Young generation
> eden
> s0,s1 (surviver space)
2. Old generation.
>tenured
3. Permanent generation
>permamanet

>> Diff Types of GC:
1. Searial
2. Parallel
3. CMS
4. G1(Garbaze first)

>>>2. Serialiaztion & Externalizable:
---------------------
Serialiaztion: is a marker inteface and its write every thing in file accept transiant and static variable.

Externalizable: is not marker inteface.

The main advantage of Externalizable over serialization is, everything is taken care of by the programmer and JVM doesn’t have any control
Transient keywords won’t play any role.

class ExternalizableDemo implements Externalizable{
public void  writeExternal( ObjectOutput obj ) throws IOException{}
public void  readExternal(ObjectInput  in )throws IOException , ClassNotFoundException{}
}
