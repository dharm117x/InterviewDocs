------------------------------------
> Flush can be rollback but after commit not possible.
> Flush will synchronize database with currrent state of objects in memory but not commit transaction.
> Flush can use in batch process to avoid outoffmemory error.


2. How to improve database perperformance:
------------------------------------------
> Data indexing
  > Identified frequently accesses columns
  > Composite index
  > Avoid over indexing

> Query optimization
 > Avoid select * instead of specific column
 > Limit results
 > Filter data early-Use where clause as early as possible.
 > Use JOIN wisely- 

> Database caching
 > Query result caching
 > Object caching

> Database normilaztion
> Hardware Optimization
> Database Tuning
> Backup and Recovery
> Partitioning
