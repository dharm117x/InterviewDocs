1. Diff flush() and commit() methods.
------------------------------------
> Flush can be rollback but after commit not possible.
> Flush will synchronize database with currrent state of objects in memory but not commit transaction.
> Flush can use in batch process to avoid outoffmemory error.


2. How to improve database perperformance:
------------------------------------------
> Data indexing
  > Identified frequently accesses columns
  > Composite index
  > Avoid over indexing

> Query optimization
 > Avoid select * instead of specific column
 > Limit results
 > Filter data early-Use where clause as early as possible.
 > Use JOIN wisely- 

> Database caching
 > Query result caching
 > Object caching

> Database normilaztion
> Hardware Optimization
> Database Tuning
> Backup and Recovery
> Partitioning 

3. SQL JOINS
---------------
Employee, Department

1. INNER
 > Select all rows from both tables based on condtions satisfied.
2. LEFT/ LEFT OUTER
 > Select all rows from left tables and matching result from right side table.
3. RIGHT
 > Select all rows from Right tables and matching result from left side table.
4. FULL 
 > Craete results by combining LEFT and RIGHT join, its contain all the row from both tables
5. NATURAL
 > Tow tables join using cross join. and both table have at leaset one column with same name and type.
6. SELF
 > 

4. UNION and UNION ALL
-------------------------
The UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set.
> union:  combined result with same column name and type and avoid duplicate.
> unions: Add duplicate value as well.

select city, name from Customer
UNION
select city, name from Employee
order by city

Condition from UNION :
1. select statement have same numbers have columns.
2. The columns must have same data type.
3. The column of every select statement must have in same order and same name.

>> Differentiate between the WHERE clause and the HAVING clause in Oracle SQL. 

The WHERE clause filters rows before grouping – that is, before they’re included in the result set. Filtering is also based on certain conditions. 
The HAVING clause, on the other hand, filters data post-grouping – meaning after aggregation. 

5. Select Query:
----------------
> odd/even data from table:

select * from Table where rownumber % 2 ==0 // even row
select * from Table where rownumber % 2 !=0 // odd row

> Select Max Nth salary from employee:
// by dens_rank()
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT emp_name, emp_salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY emp_salary DESC) AS r
  FROM emp
) AS subquery
WHERE r = 3;

// by limit
SELECT MIN(sal) FROM Employee WHERE sal IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT sal
  FROM Employee
  ORDER BY sal DESC
  LIMIT 4
);

Select emp_sal from Emp order by emp_sal DESC limit 3,1;

// by top
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE sal = 
         (
            SELECT MIN(sal) FROM Employee 
            WHERE  sal IN (
            SELECT DISTINCT TOP N
            sal FROM Employee 
            ORDER BY sal DESC
))

> Write an Oracle SQL query to find the average salary of employees within each department.

SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

> max salry by dept.

SELECT DEPT_ID, MAX(SALARY) FROM department GROUP BY DEPT_ID;

> Write an Oracle SQL query to find employees who earn more than their managers.

SELECT emp.*
FROM Employee emp
INNER JOIN Employee mgr ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
WHERE emp.salary > mgr.salary;
