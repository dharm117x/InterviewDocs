>>Exception Handling in Apache Kafka:
--------------------------------------
1. TimeoutException: 
This exception is thrown when a timeout occurs while waiting for a response from Kafka. 
This can happen if the broker is unavailable, if there is network congestion, or if the request takes too long to complete.

2. KafkaError:
It can be caused by a variety of issues, such as invalid input, authorization errors, or connection issues.

3. SerializationError:
This exception is thrown when there is an error while serializing or deserializing data in Kafka. This can happen if the data is in an unsupported format
or if there is a mismatch between the expected and actual data types

4. OffsetOutOfRangeError: 
This exception is thrown when the consumer attempts to read from an offset that is outside the valid range of offsets for a partition. 
This can happen if the offset is too old or if it has been deleted

1.Understand the logs:
The first step to troubleshoot any Kafka problem is to understand the logs. Kafka produces various types of logs, 
such as broker logs, controller logs, consumer logs, producer logs, and connect logs.

2.Identify the root cause:
This means finding out which component, configuration, or code is causing the error or exception, and why. 
You can use tools such as JMX, metrics, or tracing to monitor and measure the performance and behavior of the Kafka components.
You can also use tools such as ZooKeeper CLI, Kafka Admin API, or Kafka CLI to inspect and manage the Kafka cluster, topics, partitions, 
replicas, offsets, and consumers. You should also test and validate your code, such as producer and consumer clients, connectors,
or stream processors, and check for any bugs, compatibility issues, or resource leaks

3.Apply the solution:
we can use tools such as Kafka Reassign Partitions Tool, Kafka Preferred Replica Election Tool, or Kafka MirrorMaker to perform maintenance 
and recovery operations on the Kafka cluster, such as rebalancing, migrating, or replicating data. You can also use tools such as Kafka Console Producer, 
Kafka Console Consumer, or Kafka Avro Console Consumer to test and verify the data quality and consistency after applying the solution.
