>> LLD (Low level design pattern)
----------------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ Purpose: Provides a detailed design for individual components and modules.
ðŸ”¹ Focus: Covers implementation details, class structure, algorithms, and design patterns.
ðŸ”¹ Key Elements:

Class diagrams and sequence diagrams
Data flow diagrams
Database indexing strategies
API request/response models
Code-level design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, etc.)
Error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms

--------------------

1. Understand Requirements
Functional & non-functional requirements
Inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases

2. Identify Entities and Relationships
Define key objects and how they interact
Use class diagrams to represent objects

3. Define Class Structure
Use OOP principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
Identify necessary attributes and methods

4. Select Design Patterns
Factory Pattern (for object creation)
Singleton Pattern (for single-instance objects)
Observer Pattern (for event-driven architecture)
Strategy Pattern (for interchangeable behaviors)

5. Database Design
Define schema with primary and foreign keys
Optimize using indexing and normalization

6. Sequence Diagrams
Define how components interact step by step

7. API Contracts
Define request/response structure
Mention error handling & retry mechanisms


>> HLD (High level design pattern)
----------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ Purpose: Provides an overview of the system architecture and major components.
ðŸ”¹ Focus: Describes how different modules interact at a higher level without going into implementation details.
ðŸ”¹ Key Elements:

Architecture diagrams (Microservices, Monolith, Layered, etc.)
Database schema (Entity-Relationship Model)
API definitions (REST endpoints, GraphQL, etc.)
Tech stack selection (Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.)
Communication flow (between services, databases, etc.)
Security considerations (Authentication, Authorization, OAuth, etc.)
