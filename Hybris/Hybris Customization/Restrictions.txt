1. Item restriction:
-------------------------
A restriction in Hybris is a set of rules applied to flexible searches in order to limit the search results based on certain specific 
conditions. By default, restrictions are not applied on admingroup members, admin will always get the full results.

Create restriction
INSERT_UPDATE SearchRestriction	;code[unique=true]			;name[lang=en]			       ;principal(UID);restrictedType(code);active;generate	;query
			                    ;customerWithoutAnonymous	;Customer Anonymous Restriction;employeegroup ;Customer		       ;true  ;true		;{uid} NOT LIKE 'anonymous'

code: Unique id code of the restriction.

name: Name of the restriction.

principal: User/user group to whom the restriction will be applied.

restrictedType: Item type to which the restriction will be applied on.

active: true means the restriction is enabled, false is disabled.

query: conditions to be added to the WHERE clause of the flexible search

Use restriction
When you run a flexible search query on CustomerModel as a User who belongs to the employeegroup.
SELECT {pk}, {uid} FROM {Customer}

The restriction query will systematically be added to the flexible search.
SELECT {pk}, {uid} FROM {Customer} WHERE {uid} NOT LIKE 'anonymous'
								
2. CMS restriction:
-------------------------
We can restrict a page or component from being displayed to specified users or user groups, on specified dates etc..

There are different types of restrictions like user restriction, user group restriction, time restriction etc..
We can apply restriction either to a page or to a component.

We can apply restriction through impex or directly through CMS Cockpit.

Step 1: Define new CMS Restriction and provide the reference of page/component on which restriction has to be applied

$contentCatalog=myStoreContentCatalog
$contentCV=catalogVersion(CatalogVersion.catalog(Catalog.id[default=$contentCatalog]),CatalogVersion.version[default=Staged])[default=$contentCatalog:Staged]

INSERT_UPDATE CMSUserRestriction;$contentCV[unique=true];uid[unique=true];name;users(uid);components(&componentRef);&componentRef
;;AnonymousUserRestriction;Anonymous User Restriction;anonymous;LoginLink;AnonymousUserRestriction

INSERT_UPDATE CMSUserGroupRestriction;$contentCV[unique=true];uid[unique=true];name;userGroups(uid);includeSubgroups;components(&linkRef)
;;MyAccountLinkApproverGroupRestriction;My Account Link Approver Group Restriction;b2bapprovergroup;true;ApprovalDashboardLink

Step 2: Synchronize the content catalog so that restriction is available in online catalog.
