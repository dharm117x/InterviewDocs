>>Why is a shell script needed?
-----------------------------------
Keeping repetitive tasks to a minimum.
Can be used by system administrators for routine backups.
Monitoring the system.
Adding new functions to the shell.
Shell scripting allows you to create your own tools.
System admin can automate daily task

>>> What do you mean by Shell variable?
Shell variables are integral parts of all Shell programs and scripts.
variable ="Hello" 
echo $variable

> Shell scripts usually have two types of variables:  
System-defined variables Ex: SHELL
User-defined variables EX: $ a=10 

>>> What are interactive and non-interactive shells?
Interactive shell: /bin/bash and /bin/sh is interactive shell. It is a non-login shell that gets started from a command line. It first copies the parent environment and then invokes.

Non-Interactive shell: /sbin/nologin shell is non-interactive shell. It is present when the shell script is running and just inherits the parent's environment


>>> What is the shebang line in shell scripting?
Shell scripts or programs often contain shebang at the top. In general, the Shebang (the series of characters "#!") is used to indicate the operating system to use a particular interpreter to process the rest of the file. Here, the symbol '#' is referred to as hash, and "!" is referred to as bang.

Ex: #!/bin/bash  

>>> Tell us about the ‘$#’ use in shell scripting.
'$#' is used to display the total number of passed arguments to the script. 

>>> How will you pass and access arguments to a script in Linux?
In scripts, arguments are passed as follows: 
scriptName "Arg1" "Arg2"…."Argn" 

Arguments in a script can be accessed as follows: 
$1 , $2 .. $n

>>> Differentiate between $@ and $*.
$* considers an entire set of positional arguments as a single string whereas, $@ treats each quote argument as a separate argument.  

>>> What is the use of the "$?" command?
By using the command "$?", you can find out the status of the last command executed

>>> What is the best way to run a script in the background?
For a script to run in the background, simply add "&" at the end of the command.
Ex: script.sh &

>>> What is the lifespan of a shell variable?
A variable is inside the shell script only until the end of execution. 

>>> How will you debug a shell script?
With set, you can turn on or off debugging options in the shell: 

Set -x: This displays commands and their arguments as they are being executed.
Set -v: It displays shell input lines in real-time as they are read

>>> Write the difference between $$ and $!?
You can use $$ to get the process id of the current process. However, $! displays the process id for a background process that recently went away.

>>> In what ways, shell script get input values?
By reading command: read -p "Destination backup Server: " dest host
By parameters: ./script param1 param2

>> Way of compare the strings in a shell script.
Comparison of file attributes
Comparison of strings
Comparing basic arithmetic operations

test 50 -gt 40 && echo "Yes" || echo "No"
Because 50 is greater than 40, this command prints the text "Yes".

["Excellent" = "Excellent"]; echo $?
As the two strings are identical, this command prints "0" because the expression is true


>>> Explain ways to create shortcuts in Linux?
Hard Link: ard links are mirror images of the originally linked files and are linked with an inode number. A hard-linked file remains even after the original file is deleted.

$ ln  [original filename] [link name]
Soft Link:When a soft link is created or deleted, it does not affect the original file, but when the original file is deleted, the soft link stops working.
$ ln  -s [original filename] [link name]

-h file      //true if the file is a symbolic link
-L file      //true if the file is a symbolic link


>>> Please tell us how you will check if a file exists on the filesystem.
if [ -f /var/log/messages ]
then
echo "File exists."
fi

>>> What is the difference between [[ $string == "efg*" ]] and [[ $string == efg* ]] ?
[[ $string == efg* ]] – checks if string begins with efg. 

[[ $string == "efg*" ]] – checks if string is efg. 

>>> Ddifference between grep and find command.
Grep command: This command facilitates searching and displaying content based on regular expressions specified by the user.
grep “apple” file1.txt
grep “apple” file1.txt  file2.tx

Find command: The FIND command searches for files and folders based on their size, modification time, and access time
find –type  f
find .  –name file1.txt

>>>  How to use pipe commands?
Pipe command allows you to use several commands in the same way, in which the output of one is used as input for another
command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N
